                        Husky Kiosk focuses on empowering formerly-incarcerated students at the University of
                        Washington. Formerly-incarcerated people are one of the most marginalized and
                        underrepresented demographics, particularly in higher education. Because of this, we sought
                        to become allies and find a way for information technology to ease the undue burden on
                        system-impacted people. After consulting many stakeholders, including formerly-incarcerated
                        students themselves, we laid out a model for a physical space to serve as a gathering place
                        and safe space for the system-impacted community at UW. In addition to this, we built an
                        website to host informational resources to help provide information and education about
                        topics of housing, finance, the UW landscape, and other resources pertinent to our
                        stakeholders. This project was initially created for our INFO 360 (Design Inquiry) class.

                        Swordfish is an econometrics app centered built around stock regression. Since the stock
                        market is so pervasive in our lives with the news, our retirement portfolios, and personal
                        employment considerations, we figured building a tool to give users a little more insight
                        into it would be very worthwhile, would be a great way to demonstrate how front-end and
                        back-end programming could be brought together at a basic level. With Swordfish, users are
                        able to see the relationships between a stock of their choice (such as AAPL, AMZN, TSLA,
                        etc.) and a wide array of economic variables. This web app was made for our INFO 360
                        (Client-Side Web Development) class.

        {/*     People are generally excited about stocks due to their speculative nature
      so we decided to start here. R is an incredible tool which (among other things)
      we used to build this application and think people who are interested in
      econometrics would think R is a great place to start!

      Swordfish was built to be an econometrics app with two overarching goals.

To get people interested in econometrics
To teach people something about econometrics

Since the stock market is so pervasive in our lives with the news, our retirement
portfolios, and personal employment considerations, we figured building a tool to
give users a little more insight into it would be very worthwhile, and be a great
way to demonstrate how front-end and back-end programming could be brought together
to build an amazing tool such as this.

The tools we used to create Swordfish include bootstrapping it with the Create React
App, HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, R, Plumber, Digital Ocean, and Docker. But our most
important tool enabling us was our own personal necessity. We had been yearning for a
tool like this one to improve our own knowledge of investing, and now we hope it can
benefit anyone and everyone that comes across this repo. */}
