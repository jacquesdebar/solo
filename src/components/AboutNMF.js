            ABOUT THIS SITE
          </h3>
          <p>
            Welcome to NMF. I have built this site to highlight my favorite new
            releases each week. They range from hip-hop to country, indie pop to
            orchestral, and more. Some weeks, there may be only one or two that I
            feel are worth highlighting. Other weeks may boast a dozen brilliant
            albums to include. This is one of those weeks. I want to stress that{" "}
            <strong>this is a subjective site</strong> based upon my own taste and
            brief experience with the projects (and a little bit of some friends'
            as well). If you take issue with projects that were or were not
            included, cool. Maybe I didn't know about it and completely missed out
            on a great album. Maybe I heard it and hated listening to it due to
            our clashing music tastes. Or more likely, maybe I heard it and
            decided it was a fine album but did not hold up to the others in the
            collection. That being said, please do reach out and let me know if
            you think there was something that flew under my radar and should be
            featured on this page.
          </p>

            Special thanks to Hari, Joe, Maya, Wil, and Chloe for helping me curate.

            One last note: I don't display music from artists who have shown to be
            abusers, predators, misogynists, or bigots. If you are upset about not
            seeing Chris Brown, G-Eazy, or Azealia Banks on these lists, this is
            why. Good thing their music isn't good anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the coming weeks, I plan on developing a rating system to include
            on the listings below. I also intend on keeping archives of each
            month's selections. If you have any questions, suggestions, or
            feedback, please email me at{" "}
