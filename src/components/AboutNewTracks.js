        In addition to the albums above, I am also compliling playlists of the
        best tracks of the week. Below you will find three playlists. Each of
        these is designed to have it's own energy level (high, medium, or low)
        so that your ears and brain experience minimal listening whiplash.
        Though I realize that having three playlists introduces an element of
        choice-paralysis (thanks Pari), I did not feel that it was in any of
        our best interest to throw all of them into one listening bucket. Call
        me crazy, but I just can't go from Trap this Way straight into Dear
        April.

        Next week, I will be looking into functionality to allow for track
        submissions, as there are undoubtedly some gems from today that are
        missing from these playlists. Again, if you have any questions,
        submissions, or feedback, please do not hesitate to contact me.

        NOTE: The songs in these playlists are unordered and not organized to
        form a coherent mix, so shuffle away.
